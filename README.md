# RevAssessBasicDAO

You are tasked with creating a DAO implementation for a book enitity. You will find in the code an interface called **BookDAO**. You should make a class that implements the BookDAO interface. There is a test class called BookDAOtests. On line 22 you should replace the null with an instance of the BookDAO implementation you wrote. The tests are designed to run in order. So run them all at once to ensure proper results. For this exercise you should not have to edit the pom.xml. 
- You are responsible for creating a table in a your own SQL database.
- You are responsible for creating a connection to that SQL database
- Do not edit the RevAssessConfig.json
- You may use any notes you want or look online for documenation/stack overflow but you should not reach out to other batchmates.
